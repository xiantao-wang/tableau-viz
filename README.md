**Data Visualization: The Use of English Names among Legislative Councilors in Hong Kong**

Hong Kong is a unique territory that was once colonized by Britain for over 150 years and handed back to China in 1997. It is where the common law encounters Chinese Confucianism and where the West blends with the East.

It is under this context that I focus on the use of English names among lawmakers in Hong Kong since 1998. Names are cultural tokens that convey meanings with regard to identity, class, and status. I attempted to disclose the association between the use of English names and other variables like political stance, constituency, and gender.

Conclusions:
1. Female lawmakers are more likely to have English names than male lawmakers;
2. Functional Constituencies where corporate interests are the most influential consistently have greater portions of lawmakers who have English names;
3. There is no association between regional income and the percentage of lawmakers using English names in Geographic Constituencies;
4. There is a strong association between the base of a party and its percentage of lawmakers who have English names;
5. However, in recent years, pro-Beijing political groups that historically garnered support from lower-income households are actively promoting its image by canvassing for young well-educated lawmakers who have English names. Vincent Cheng Wing-shun (鄭泳舜) from DAB (民建聯) is a good example.
